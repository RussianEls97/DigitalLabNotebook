 # Tables 
 
 You can create tables easily with the markdown: 
 
 | Name | Occupation | Favourite Lolly |
 |----|----|----|
 | Riku | RAF | Sour Peach |
 | Hugh | Bioinformatician | Cherry |
 | Josh | PhD Student | Malteser |
 
 You need three or more lines, and table wont be fomratted and also makes the first row the header row
 
 Some tip(s): 
 * align columns using colon : on either side or both sides e.g.
 
 | Name | Occupation | Favourite Lolly |
 |----|----:|:----:|
 | Riku | RAF | Sour Peach |
 | Hugh | Bioinformatician | Cherry |
 | Josh | PhD Student | Malteser |
 
 So align to the right and align to the middle
 
 * Tables will not render on markdown as not part of spec. 95% is transferable, *tables are not official markdown, use with caution*
