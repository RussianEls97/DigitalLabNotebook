# Header -- "hashtag followed by space gives you a header, and No. of hashtags used changes size i.e more hashtages = smaller text"

## Second Header

### Third Header

####### 6th Header

Type lots of - (minus) to add a horizontal line 
Anothwer way is to type a lot of _ (underscore) e.g.: 
________

# Text styles 
If you want a **bold** or *italics* use asterick on either side 

You can also use underscores for the same effect:
__bold__ or _italics_ 

So 2 of either asterick or underscore for bold and 1 of either of italics 

You can combine **_bold and italics_**

You do strikethrough with ~tilde~ 

# Lists and Bullet Points
To create lists, begin a line with an asterick, or minus: 

* item 1
* item 2
* item 3 

remember use a space after the asterick or you will get italics! 

This is with minus:

- item 1
- item 2
- item 3

You can make sub point with 2 spaces before a point: 
* item 1
  * sub-item 1
  * sub-item 2
* item 2

To create a numbered list: 
1. item 1
1. item 2
1. item 3

you do not have to write out 1, 2, 3 etc just use 1 and it will automatically fo it for you :3 easy-peasy!
